The slides for my presentation at [The Louisville Agile Forum on July 20th, 2016][event].

[event]: http://www.meetup.com/Louisville-Agile-Forum/events/231741799/

Summary
-------

We'll take a close look at the relationship between agile workflows and automated software testing.  We'll discuss how automated tests impact software being an asset, expense, or liability (metaphorically speaking).  We will then explore automated testing best practices and how to get started writing tests.
