Description
-----------

A great development workflow will make your good developers great, and your great developers exceptional and automation is a cornerstone of a great development workflow. Every task that can be done by a machine should be. Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of testing each change done to your codebase automatically and as early as possible. Learn how to increase the quality of your code and improve team productivity by leveraging a CI pipeline to run tests, lint, and measure code coverage. Then, integrate all that knowledge right into a GitHub pull request for easy team review & verification before deployment.
