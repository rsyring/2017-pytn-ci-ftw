Description
-----------

Learn how to increase the quality of your code and improve team productivity by leveraging a CI pipeline to run tests, lint, and measure code coverage. Then, integrate all that knowledge right into a GitHub pull request for easy team review & verification before deployment. Finally, discuss the cultural challenges that can be met by those that want to integrate CI into their team.
